Project: # CVIP_DataScience_NormalTask
Description: Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd

Steps:
Download the dataset or you can directly use the link to import the dataset in your Jupyter code file

If you want to directly use the link without downloading the data then you just have to edit the import command (pd.read_csv('')) on the Jupyter code file 
Dataset: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd'
df = pd.read_csv(dataset)
or
If you download the dataset then put the Dataset and code file in the same folder and run as it is my code file's commands

Download libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Then you are good to go, you can directly run the code file
